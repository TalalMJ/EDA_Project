# Analysis of Parental level of education influence on students grades (MVP)
The purpose of the analysis is to understand the influence of various factors like economic, personal and social on the students performance

From my first impression we get the answer of does parental level of education effect the students overall performance.
Conclusion from first impression is that the parental level of education doesn't have an influence on students grades.
